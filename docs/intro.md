# Introduction: The Dawn of Physical AI

Welcome to the world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This book is your guide to one of the most exciting and rapidly developing fields in technology. We are on the cusp of a new era where artificial intelligence is breaking free from the digital world and entering our physical reality. This transition from disembodied AI to **embodied intelligence** is not just a technological leap; it's a fundamental shift in how we will live, work, and interact with the world around us.

## The Future is Embodied

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This book introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. You will learn to apply your AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## What You Will Learn

This book is structured to take you on a journey from the fundamental principles of Physical AI to the hands-on development of autonomous humanoid robots. Here's a glimpse of what you'll learn:

*   **Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence**
*   **Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control**
*   **Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity**
*   **Develop with the NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform**
*   **Design humanoid robots for natural interactions**
*   **Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics**
