# 2.1 ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Explain the ROS 2 architecture and its layers
- Understand DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware
- Describe Quality of Service (QoS) policies and when to use them
- Define and navigate the computational graph (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Compare ROS 1 and ROS 2 design philosophies
- Recognize why ROS 2 is the standard for modern robotics

## Status: In Progress

This section is being created by the technical writing sub-agent. Expected delivery: **December 7, 2025**.

**Research Phase**: Input from robotics_researcher - [Task 1.1 Details](./CHAPTER2_WORKFLOW.md#task-11-research-ros-2-architecture-and-dds)

## Coming Soon

This section will cover:
- **ROS 2 Ecosystem Overview**: History, motivation, and modern robotics needs
- **DDS Middleware**: What it is, why it matters, how it enables distributed computing
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Reliability policies, deadlines, liveliness, and when each matters
- **Computational Graph**: Nodes, topics, services, actions, and their relationships
- **ROS 1 vs ROS 2**: Key differences and why the redesign was necessary
- **Real-World Impact**: How ROS 2 enables physical AI and humanoid robotics

**Code Examples Included**:
- Your first ROS 2 node
- Visualization of a computational graph
- QoS configuration examples
