# 2.2 Nodes and Communication Patterns

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Create your first ROS 2 node
- Understand publisher/subscriber (topic) communication
- Understand request/response (service) communication
- Understand long-running task (action) communication
- Choose the appropriate pattern for different use cases
- Write Python code to implement each pattern

## Status: In Progress

This section is being created by the technical writing sub-agent. Expected delivery: **December 9, 2025**.

**Research Phase**: Input from robotics_researcher - [Task 1.2 Details](./CHAPTER2_WORKFLOW.md#task-12-research-ros-2-communication-patterns)

## Coming Soon

This section will cover:
- **Creating Your First Node**: Simple ROS 2 node structure
- **Publisher/Subscriber Pattern**: Continuous data streams
- **Service Pattern**: Request/response interactions
- **Action Pattern**: Long-running tasks with feedback
- **Decision Matrix**: When to use each pattern
- **Custom Message Types**: Defining your own messages
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world humanoid robot scenarios

**Code Examples Included**:
- Publisher node reading sensor data
- Subscriber node processing data
- Service server providing computations
- Service client requesting services
- Action server for robot movement
- Action client with feedback handling
